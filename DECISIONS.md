# Decisions Log

Running log of choices made and why. Lightweight — one entry per real decision (a choice between two
or more real alternatives), newest at the top.

## 2026-08-24 — Language/runtime: TypeScript on Node.js

**Chosen:** TypeScript/Node for the matching engine and Sprint 1 CLI.

**Alternatives considered:** Python — arguably a faster path for the CSV wrangling and matching-algorithm
work itself (pandas, pytest), and simpler for one-off synthetic data generation.

**Why TypeScript/Node:** The PRD's Epic 3 (mobile-friendly, on-the-spot adjustments) and the broader
goal of hosting matchups on a website mean this needs a web frontend eventually. Sharing one language
across the matching engine and that future UI avoids a second stack and a serialization boundary
between them.

## 2026-08-24 — Priority tracking: BACKLOG.md order, not the GitHub Project board

**Chosen:** story order in BACKLOG.md (top to bottom, epic by epic) is the source of truth for priority.

**Alternatives considered:** a Priority field on the GitHub Project board, or the board's drag-to-reorder
position within a column.

**Why the file, not the board:** manual card position in a Projects (v2) board view isn't exposed by the
GraphQL API or `gh project item-list` — there's no way to read it back programmatically, so it can't
drive anything automated. A Priority field would be readable but is one more place to keep in sync. The
board still owns status (Todo/In Progress/Done); the file owns order.
