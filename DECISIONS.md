## 2026-08-24 — Language/runtime: TypeScript on Node.js

**Chosen:** TypeScript/Node for the matching engine and Sprint 1 CLI.

**Alternatives considered:** Python — arguably a faster path for the CSV wrangling and matching-algorithm
work itself (pandas, pytest), and simpler for one-off synthetic data generation.

**Why TypeScript/Node:** The PRD's Epic 3 (mobile-friendly, on-the-spot adjustments) and the broader
goal of hosting matchups on a website mean this needs a web frontend eventually. Sharing one language
across the matching engine and that future UI avoids a second stack and a serialization boundary
between them.
